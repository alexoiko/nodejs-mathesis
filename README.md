# nodejs-mathesis

A website where you can create an account and add books and comments to it.

This website was written for the purposes of completing the course CS3.3: Web application development with node.js of mathesis.

Given a template, the goal was to make the site functional, to make it possible for the users to add/edit/delete comments to their books, 
to read the other users comment of the same book and to create an online database using postgreSQL.
